# Variational Continual Learning: Replication and Beyond

This is complementary code for a study done at the Advanced Machine Learning course in the MLMI programme at Cambridge University Engineering Department. It explores the variational continual learning (VCL) framework as proposed by Nguyen, Li, Bui, and Turner (ICLR 2018). Although all of our results are included, note that this repo requires significant clean-up for out-of-the-box use.
